Algometer

This application has been developed to test algorithmic skills.
Intended usage starts before users / test subjects learn to read and write.

Before you start:
You need to create a txt file and copy it to the root folder of your Android device.
This is also where test results will be found in a csv file.

Txt file description:
name: minta.txt
sample exercise: Ex 1.
                 -**-
                 *--*
                 -*-*
                 --**
                 -**-
Where '*' means light is on, '-' means light is off.
